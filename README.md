# Setup-Selenium-Web-Browser-Automation-and-Asp.net-Core
There exist many kind of test: unit tests, integration tests , acceptance test, ..., UI tests.
For this tutorial, we will be interested on UI tests, indeed this kind  of test, allows us to validate the IHM by launching the browser, clicking  on elements and verify the result.

So we can validate the behaviour of the application on many browsers : chrome, safari, firefox, internet explorer, etc...

We can also use a specific version of a browser : for sample  IE9

in this tutorial, we will not show how to write Selenium test  but we will focus on browser automation in order to execution of UI  tests on a build environnement.
